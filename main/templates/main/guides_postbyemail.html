    <h1>Post by email</h1>
    <p>
        Mataroa supports publishing blog posts via email, inspired by <a href="https://posthaven.com/">Posthaven</a>.
    </p>

    {% if request.user.is_authenticated and not request.user.is_premium %}
    <p>
        This is a premium feature. <a href="{% url 'billing_overview' %}">Upgrade to Premium</a> to use it.
    </p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if request.user.is_authenticated and not request.user.email %}
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        An email address is required to use this feature. <a href="{% url 'user_update' %}">Add in settings</a>.
    </p>
    {% endif %}

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ol>
        {% if request.user.is_authenticated and request.user.email %}
        <li>
            Either send an email from {{ request.user.email }} to
            <code>post@{{ request.user.username }}.{{ canonical_host }}</code>
            to publish immediately.
        </li>
        <li>Or from {{ request.user.email }} to
            <code>draft@{{ request.user.username }}.{{ canonical_host }}</code>
            to save as a draft.
        </li>
        {% else %}
        <li>
            Either send an email from your registered email address to
            <code>post@{username}.{{ canonical_host }}</code> to publish immediately.
        </li>
        <li>Or send an email from your registered email address to
            <code>draft@{username}.{{ canonical_host }}</code> to save as a draft.
        </li>
        {% endif %}
        <li>The email subject becomes the post title.</li>
        <li>The email body becomes the post content.</li>
        <li>You receive a reply email with the link to your post.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You must send the email from the same email address that is
            registered with your mataroa account. Emails from other addresses
            will be ignored.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drafts do not appear in a blog's home page but are accessible
            directly from their URL.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only the plain text version of the email is used for the post body.
            HTML formatting in your email will not be preserved.
        </li>
        <li>
            The post slug is automatically generated from the email subject
            (which becomes the post title).
        </li>
    </ul>
