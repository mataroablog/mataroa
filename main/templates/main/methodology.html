    <h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
    <p>
        mataroa's mission is to provide a space for people to write without
        distractions and help them publish in minimal fashion.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>
    <p>We are committed to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No tracking of user or visitor behaviour.</li>
        <li>Never sell any user or visitor data.</li>
        <li>No ads — ever.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="code-of-publication">Code of Publication</h2>
    <p>
        Mataroa is designed to be a place for people to voice their thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we do not want to provide a platform for thoughts that
        are spiteful or malevolent to an individual or a group on account of
        their race, colour, nationality, sex, disability, religion, or sexual
        orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, we want to contribute to a human-focused web, in contrast
        to a bot-focused web. Specifically, low quality content not designed to be
        read by humans is now allowed and will be deleted upon discovery.
    </p>

    <h2 id="comments-moderation">Comments Moderation</h2>
    <p>
        We enable blog authors to filter, review, approve, and delete the
        comments they receive from their users.
    </p>

    <h2 id="business-transparency">Business Transparency</h2>
    <p>
        We aim to be transparent. We maintain a
        <a href="{% url 'transparency' %}">Business Transparency</a>
        page with data on our revenue and costs.
    </p>

    <h2 id="account-terms">Account Terms</h2>
    <p>
        The user is responsible for all content posted and all actions
        performed with their account.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user is responsible for maintaining the security of their
        account and password.
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to disable or delete a user's account for any
        reason at any time. We have this clause because, statistically
        speaking, there will be people trying to do something nefarious.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not require an email address to register an account. However,
        it is the only way for us to contact a user in cases of any
        service update or account access restoration. For this reason,
        having an email registered is very useful.
    </p>

    <h2 id="account-data">Account Data</h2>
    <p>
        In order to have a functional mataroa.blog account a username and a
        password are required. An email is also asked as it is the only way for
        a user to restore their account in case of a forgotten password.
        However, an email is not required.
    </p>
    <p>
        A user is able to change their username and password and any other
        details (eg. email) through their
        <a href="{% url 'dashboard' %}">dashboard</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A user is able to export all their data directly and at any point
        through the <a href="{% url 'export_index' %}">export</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
        A user is able to completely delete their account and all information
        related to their account through the dashboard, and then navigating to
        <a href="{% url 'user_update' %}">blog settings</a>, and scrolling all
        the way down. In this case, the user account will be immediately
        purged from our primary servers and 20 days later from our database
        backups.
    </p>

    <h2 id="payments">Payments</h2>
    <p>
        We offer a Premium Plan of our service which requires payment. If a
        user opts for the Premium Plan they are billed immediately for the
        next one year term, and automatically billed every year unless cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
        We accept card payments through <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>,
        but if one is not fond of this method we support alternatives. Please,
        email <a href="mailto:admin@mataroa.blog">admin@mataroa.blog</a> for
        and with details.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also fund CO₂ removal from the atmosphere using 5% of our
        subscription revenue through
        <a href="https://climate.stripe.com/QPSBFx">Stripe Climate</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="refunds">Refunds</h2>
    <p>
        We wouldn’t want to cause unhappiness. Any dissatisfied with our
        service user can ask—and most probably get—a refund at
        <a href="mailto:admin@mataroa.blog">admin@mataroa.blog</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="liability">Liability</h2>
    <p>
        The user expressly understands and agrees that Zermelo Fraenkel LTD,
        the operators of this website shall not be liable, in law or in equity,
        to them or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental,
        lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages.
    </p>

    <h2 id="third-parties">Third-parties</h2>
    <p>
        We have a strong commitment to never share any user data with any
        third-parties. The only neccessary exception to this rule is the
        payment processor we use to accept card payments. That processor is
        <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> and the data sent over are
        card numbers. This enables us to never—not even temporarily—store card
        details on our servers and benefit from Stripe’s secure,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI-compliant</a>
        payment infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please bear in mind that Stripe may also collect other data, such as IP
        address and browser user agent.
    </p>

    <h2 id="service-availability">Service Availability</h2>
    <p>
        We provide the mataroa.blog service on an “as is” and “as available”
        basis. We do not offer service-level agreements—but do take uptime
        seriously. You can find a record of outages on our blog at
        <a href="https://hey.mataroa.blog/">hey.mataroa.blog</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="contact-and-support">Contact and Support</h2>
    <p>
        Email us at <a href="mailto:admin@mataroa.blog">admin@mataroa.blog</a>
        with any queries.
    </p>

    <h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
    <p>
        We have a creed to write <a href="https://fsfe.org/freesoftware" title="Free Software explanation on FSFE website">free software</a>.
        Mataroa is developed publicly on

    </p>
    <p>
        There is no backlog or roadmap or issue/ticket system for mataroa projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use
        <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~sirodoht/mataroa-community">a mailing list</a>
