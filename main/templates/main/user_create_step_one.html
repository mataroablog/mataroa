    <h1>Welcome to Mataroa!</h1>

    <p>
        A blog is a mode of publication. We consider blogs to be a first-class citizen in online
        publishing. A simple form to express and distribute ideas on the internet.
    </p>
        We designed Mataroa to fulfill specific needs: the needs of those who want to
        <em>just write</em>. We offer a place of <strong>no distractions</strong> to facilitate an
        elementary mode of intellectual internetic exchange: write a blog entry.
