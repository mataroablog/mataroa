    <h1>Welcome to Mataroa!</h1>

    <p>
        A blog is a web log. A log as in the ship’s log: a record of important events during
        a ship’s journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        A blog is a mode of publication; like the book, the magazine, the television show.
        We see the blog as a first-class citizen in online publishing. The simplest—maybe default—form
        to express and distribute ideas on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is an amazing selection of publishing and distribution options.
        From tweets to articles to books, from text to image to video,
        from simple email to personalised algorithms to multimedia platforms. The present is
        futuristic. Yet we designed Mataroa to fulfill specific needs: the needs of those
        who want to just write.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            We offer a place of no distractions to facilitate the most foundational mode
            of intellectual internetic exchange: write a blog entry.
        </strong>
