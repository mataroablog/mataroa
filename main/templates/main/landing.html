    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        I care about text. I like words, and their meaning, and arguments and stories, and things
        like typography, and fonts. I don't like visual congestion, or digital waste, or needless
        complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Blogging is beautiful. It's about sharing opinions on the web about anything, with one's
        own idea of aesthetics, however weird it is—or rather, <em>especially</em> because of how
        weird it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, lately, blogging is in a bad place. It's bedridden with trashy ads, and barbaric
        tracking, and ugly complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mataroa is not like that. We built it to be about writing and writing only. We do one thing
        and that is text. Here, one will find no social networks or obtrusive subscribe-popups.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, one will notice a focus on writing regardless of how much something will be read.
        Not being read can be demotivating, especially when one is starting to write. But it
        shouldn't be. We recommend that one does not look into analytics. It's mostly fuel for ego.
    </p>

        all I know.”
        <br>— Jorge Luis Borges
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        When starting a blog, there is a dizzying amount of platforms to choose from. If you know
        what you want, go with that. <strong>But, if you're not exactly happy with the
        <a href="{% url 'comparisons' %}">well-established choices</a> and you want
        to try something new, try mataroa. We aim to be that breath of fresh air.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nota bene, though: we don't offer themes, or other bells and whistles. We just show
        text in a simple way. You pay us money ($9 per year), to keep doing that.
    </p>

    <p>
        What we respect the most is that these are your words. If you decide to take them and
        leave, we can help. Especially, if you decide to
        <a href="https://nutcroft.mataroa.blog/blog/the-ideal-blog-platform/">self-host your blog</a>.
        We provide tools, such as export to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> or
        <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> source files, and we can also redirect to your
        new domain.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is all—we hope you enjoy using mataroa and find it useful for putting down your
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory">System&nbsp;2</a> thoughts into
        words.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <details>
        <summary>Do you support custom CSS?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                No. The philosophy of mataroa is to be as minimal as possible without enabling
                too many decisions about styling. Sorry! :)
            </p>
            <p>
                Check out <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">bearblog.dev</a>, a minimalist
                blogging platform that supports custom CSS.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Can I upload images on my mataroa blog?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                Yes. Even though mataroa is a text-focused platform, we do offer some support for
                image hosting. See our <a href="{% url 'guides_images' %}">images guide</a> for more details.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Can I self-host mataroa?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                Yes. The project is
                <a href="https://github.com/mataroablog/mataroa">open source</a>
                and you can find deployment documentation
                <a href="https://github.com/mataroablog/mataroa?tab=readme-ov-file#deployment">in the README</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Can I have my own mataroa-like platform?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                Sure thing. Feel free to use our <a href="https://github.com/mataroablog/mataroa">open source code</a>
                as a starting point. Here are two examples that we like:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://github.com/capivarasdev/mataroa">https://github.com/capivarasdev/mataroa</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://github.com/linuxgoose/bocpress">https://github.com/linuxgoose/bocpress</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Why should I use mataroa instead of Substack/WordPress/etc?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                Mataroa follows a minimalist philosophy. It's fast, simple, and prioritises the
                essence, the text content, over fancy features. The platform is based on a
                design philosophy of minimalism with strong data interoperability. You own your
                data and you can export it easily as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, different platforms are optimised for different use cases.
                Have a look at our <a href="{% url 'comparisons' %}">comparison table</a>, which
                may help you decide what’s important to you.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Will you add themes?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                We are not interested in adding features that give more options to users. It's
                part of our philosophy to enable one to just write, without giving options for
                design, colours, or layouts. We understand that's not what everyone wants but we
                want to cater to people that either struggle with writing and don’t want too
                many distractions, or to people who want a minimal blog :)
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Can I add a custom favicon?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                No, we don't support custom favicons. Such a feature would allow the blog author
                to spend a lot of time figuring out what image they want to use as a favicon, which
                is the opposite of a writing place without distractions.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What about tags or categories?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                We think tags are too complicated of a feature for the simpleton mataroa wants to be.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What about pagination?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                Pagination can be annoying as it breaks the browser search across all post titles.
                Additionally, because of how fast and simple mataroa is, speed is not an issue
                even with thousands of posts.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What markdown implementation does mataroa use?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                We use the <a href="https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown">Python-Markdown</a>
                library, which implements the original markdown syntax defined by
                <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"> John Gruber’s spec</a>
                with the additions of code highlighting, tables, and footnotes.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Would you consider a rich editor option?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                We think a rich editor is too much for mataroa. For example, a rich editor
                implementation such as Trix, does looks pretty cool yet the complexity is
                too high with 200K of JavaScript code. Saving HTML in the database instead of
                simple text is also an annoyance.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Would you add support for LaTeX-style math expressions?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                We have considered this feature. We don't want to add a JavaScript library to
                handle this on the frontend. At the same time, we use markdown and mixing that with
                LaTeX breaks some of the existing blog posts' rendering, which we would be very
                reluctant to allow. We may revisit this work in the future if a better solution comes up.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What about supporting Mermaid flowcharts?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                We would not add
                <a href="https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid">mermaid-js</a>
                as it is
                <a href="https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/blob/develop/dist/mermaid.min.js">
                    2.7MB minified
                </a>
                JavaScript which is excessive for mataroa. Yet, we would be interested
                in implementing something similar if it was rendered on the backend.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Do you support ActivityPub Federation?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                No, but we would like to. This is unplanned work that might
                happen at some point in the future. We are
                <a href="https://github.com/mataroablog/mataroa?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing">open to contributions</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Do you support Bluesky/ATProto?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                No, but we would also like to. This is unplanned work that might
                happen at some point in the future. We are
                <a href="https://github.com/mataroablog/mataroa?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing">open to contributions</a>.

    <details>
        <summary>Can I integrate my mataroa blog with Google Analytics?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                No, we don't offer such functionality. Mataroa is designed as a minimal platform
                that has few features so that authors focus on content and writing rather
                than obsessing over analytics or SEO.
            </p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What kind of limits does mataroa have?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                Technical limits:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        20 TB bandwidth per month. This is about ~2 billion page visits
                        on a 1000-word blog post, which is doubtful anyone can reach it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://mataroa.blog/guides/images/">Images limits</a>:
                        Max file size 1MB, image size for all images per account 100MB,
                        total number of images 1000, bandwidth 100GB per year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Soft limit of newsletter subscribers is 15,000 email addresses.
                        We may introduce a new plan if any user crosses that in the future
                        because at that number the cost of sending emails may go up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Soft limit of blog posts is 10,000. We may introduce a
